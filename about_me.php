    <h1 class="title">My CSD Journey So Far</h1>
  <p class="indent"><br>I've been attending Villa Maria for 4 years whilst only being in the CSD Major for 3 years. I switched to this major after my first year as I thought this would've been a better fitting major. I have acquired decent coding experience from the courses that I took over the years in this major. Started from zero but didn't quite make it to hero. Still better than not have learning anything I suppose.</p>
