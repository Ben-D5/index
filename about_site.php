    <h1 class="title">The Project Idea</h1>
  <p class="indent"><br>The idea was to create a website using HTML, CSS, etc., while having the games on it coded in a different language. That language of course being Python. The result is a functioning website compiled up from a markup language and an object-oriented language. However, as you could see, that was hella impossible from the start lol. Really bad foresight on my part. JavaScript would've been the better option.</p>
